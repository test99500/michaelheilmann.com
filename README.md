- the environment shall be able to utilize target platform idiosyncracies
- the environment shall describe audials and visuals as well as logics of games by human-readable, human-editable textual documents
- the enrivonment shall utilize (deterministic) procedural generation to re-generate (from small descriptions) audials, visuals, and logics of games
- the environment shall be self-describing and have the ability to generate the code of a pure HTML5 website ready to be deployed to any webhost containing the documentation of *Arcadia*
